{"text": "renowned in history we look up in"}
{"text": "wonder and astonishment. Their exploits"}

{"text": "of mankind. But the laurels of the"}

{"text": "blood or moistened by the tears of"}
{"text": "widows and orphans. The great"}
{"text": "Naoplean Bonaparte although his fame is"}
{"text": "spread abroad as being one of the great - "}
{"text": "est Generals that ever lived; although "}
{"text": "we look upon his victories and conquests with"}
{"text": "great astonishment yet he was far from"}
{"text": "being an honorable his whole"}
{"text": "life and character is stained with"}
{"text": "many vices. But the name of"}

{"text": "long after Napoleans will be forgotten"}
{"text": "though he was not so great a"}
{"text": "general nor won so many victories"}
{"text": "and made no conquests. But he fought"}
{"text": "for the good of his country and not"}
{"text": "for the sake of conquest. True there"}
{"text": "were many hundreds who perished"}
{"text": "under his command on the different"}
{"text": "battlefields but they were fighting"}
{"text": "for their own homes their own families"}

{"text": "and will therefore make him so"}
{"text": "A rude and quarrelsome man is a"}
{"text": "wuisance to the community as well as"}

{"text": "his own he is never at peace and"}

{"text": "Parents can make no greater mistake"}

{"text": "to practice it for there is no being"}
{"text": "who is more universally hated than"}
{"text": "the liar. When a man gets into the"}
{"text": "habit of lying he knows not how"}
{"text": "great a task he has to undergo"}
{"text": "because when he tells one falsehood he"}
{"text": "has to tell a great many others to"}
{"text": "support that one and thus he keeps"}
{"text": "on steop by step until he is detected"}
{"text": "After this he is considered a nobody"}
{"text": "and the worse of it is he is never"}
{"text": "afterward believed even when he"}
{"text": "speaks the truth. A liar has always"}
{"text": "to be on his guard and watch him - "}
{"text": "self very closely lest he contradict at"}
{"text": "one time what he has said at another"}
{"text": "and thus he is always in care"}
{"text": "and anxiety. We should therefore in"}
{"text": "all our intercourse with our"}

{"text": "to truth. We should never exaggerate"}
{"text": "or tell a onesided story about anything"}
{"text": "for the very slightest deviation from"}

{"text": "hood. Truth and falsehood are two"}
